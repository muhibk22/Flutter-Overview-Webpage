        <p>Flutter is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google. It enables developers to build
            natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Known for its expressive
            and
            flexible design, Flutter uses the Dart programming language and a reactive framework. It facilitates hot
            reload
            for rapid development, offers a rich set of customizable widgets, and has gained popularity for creating
            visually appealing and high-performance cross-platform applications.</p>
        <p>Flutter was first introduced by Google in May 2017 at the Google I/O developer conference. Initially released
            as an open-source project, Flutter has undergone continuous development and improvement. The framework
            gained
            momentum due to its unique features, such as the ability to create visually consistent interfaces across
            various
            platforms. Over the years, it has evolved into a robust solution for developers seeking efficiency in
            building
            cross-platform applications. The community support and frequent updates from Google have contributed to
            Flutter's success, making it a notable player in the world of modern app development.</p>

        <p>There's alot you would need to learn before you could become an actual Flutter Developer, but don't be
            scared,
            progress one step at a time and you are good to go.</p>
        <p>Here's a roadmap of the journey:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Flutter SDK: Download from Flutter's official website. </li>
            <li>IDE: Choose Visual Studio Code or Android Studio.</li>
            <li>Dart Programming: Learn Dart basics.</li>
            <li>Emulator or Device: Test on an emulator or physical device.</li>
            <li>Git: Version control for collaborative work.</li>
            <li>Plugins: Install Flutter and Dart plugins.</li>
            <li>Text Editor: VS Code or preferred IDE.</li>
            <li>Packages: Explore Flutter packages on pub.dev.</li>
            <li>Learning Resources: Refer to Flutter documentation and tutorials.</li>
            <li>Basic Design Skills: Understand design principles.</li>
            <li>CLI Skills: Familiarity with command-line operations.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This might come off as intimidating to you if you are a beginner, but don't you worry, there are plenty of
            courses out there which will get you on your feet in no time.


        <section id="Cost" class="main-section">

                <h1>Cost</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Flutter, as an open-source framework, is free to use, and there are no licensing fees associated with
                building and deploying applications using Flutter. The costs associated with Flutter development are
                primarily
                related to the resources and services you choose to use:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Development Time: The time and effort invested in coding and design.</li>
                <li>Human Resources: Salaries for developers and designers.</li>
                <li>Third-Party Services: Costs may arise if you integrate third-party services.
                </li>
                <li>Cloud Services: If you use cloud services for hosting, storage, etc.</li>
                <li>Testing Devices: Physical devices for testing (optional but recommended).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>However, as a solo-developer, you don't need much. Just a laptop or a Desktop with the following specs
                would
                suffice:</p>
            <ol>
                <li> Operating System:<ul>
                        <li>Windows: Windows 7 SP1 or later (64-bit)</li>
                        <li>macOS: macOS (64-bit)</li>
                        <li>Linux: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later (64-bit)</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Storage: 600 MB of free space
                </li>
                <li>A minimum of 8 GB RAM</li>

            </ol>

                <h1>Syntax</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Dart is the language used for Flutter. Here is a brief overview of its syntax:</p>
            <p>Hello World:</p>
            <code>
        void main() {
  print('Hello, World!');
}

        </code>
            <p>Variables:</p>
            <code>
          String name = 'John';
int age = 25;
double height = 5.9;
bool isStudent = true;

          </code>
            <p>String Interpolation:</p>
            <code>
            String product = 'Dart';
print('I love $product programming!');

          </code>
            <p>Lists</p>
            <code>
            List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
List<String> colors = ['Red', 'Green', 'Blue'];

          </code>
            <p>Functions:</p>
            <code>
            int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Arrow syntax
int multiply(int a, int b) => a * b;

          </code>
